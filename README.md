# ODEON - Remade

This project is one of my "quick as possible" projects where I attempt to build
a new application within a holiday away from work.

In this case I had just 7 days to try and build an ODEON (Cinema) application inspired
by [this tweet](https://twitter.com/flawlessappio/status/1072084792483684352).

Part of this project was breaking down the ODEON app and beginning to understand their
internal APIs, business logic and apps behaviour in order to mimic.

In the end I made use of many ODEON APIs as well as [TheMovieDB APIs](https://www.themoviedb.org/)
in order to create a valuable experience for users. The full guide on my project can be read in [a Medium article](https://medium.com/flawless-app-stories/a-christmas-challenge-a-cinema-app-in-just-7-days-1c9aa998e765).

## Running the Project

In order to run this project, once you have cloned the repository, you will need to
define a new environment variable in the shared scheme available.

`MOVIEDB_API_KEY` should be set to the API key you can get from [TheMovieDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/account/signup).

## Dependencies

All Pods dependencies have been checked in for your convenience. As part of this project
I also wanted to experiment with something new which is why I began using [PromiseKit](https://github.com/mxcl/PromiseKit).

## Why Open Source this?

This project was built within a week. Mistakes were made, things were rushed and ultimately
the end product is not the highest quality thing I can create. However, I had fun creating
it and wanted to share it with others - if nothing else but to discuss and justify!
