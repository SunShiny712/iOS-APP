- Home
  - New, Recommended, Top Movies (API)

  - "Profile" is really just a list that can be a number of things

- Checkout the ODEON app, see what else they have
- Any other data in MovieDB or APIs I'm not using that I could render?
- Review other cinema apps, see what they have?
  - Maybe have multi-cinema support? or no...

Known Bugs:
- Edge Swipe Gesture broken?
- Some cinema screens are a bit broken (that page needs a lot of work tbh)

North Star ideas:
- Facebook Friends
  - "They watched this"
  - "They're watching this show, why not book?"
    - Show seats
- Tinder-esque Discovery?
